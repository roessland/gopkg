gopkg
=======

This project provides utility packages for programming in Go.
This serves as my library of reusable code for solving
[Project Euler](https://github.com/roessland/project-euler)
problems.

There are packages for:
- Graph problems
- Sets
- Iteration
- Set theory and combinatorics
- Number theory
- Optimization
- Prime numbers

### Versioning

`gopkg` does not use semantic versioning as it's just for my personal use.
Anything can break at any commit, but I try to create a tag whenever something
might not be backwards compatible.
